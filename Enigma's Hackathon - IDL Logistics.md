# Enigma Hackathon: Time Series Demand Planning for IDL Logistics

## Overview
This project was developed during the Enigma Hackathon, where our team created a time series forecasting solution for IDL Logistics to predict and optimize supply chain demand.

## üèÜ Challenge
<img src="IDL%20Logo.png" alt="IDL Logo" width="300">
IDL Logistics is a logistics forwarder company with over 20 years of experiences. Being a logistics forwarder, meaning their business involve with a lot of fulfillment works. This can range anything from just a small one box order, to a big multi pallets, multi boxes orders. The human resources planning therefore is incredibly important to IDL Logistics operations. 

The challenge therefore was to create a prediction pipeline that forecasts how many orders IDL Logistics will receive in a given period. We were given 12 hours to work on this project.

The dataset contains:
- 2 years of data from July 2022 to August 2023.
- And data from January 2024 to 31st December 2024.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution

We developed an ARIMA-based forecasting system that enables accurate prediction of logistics demand, helping IDL optimize their operations.
We also developed a protocol to cleaning and stablizing the high variance and trend difference that IDL Logstics have to acchive stationarity for predictions.

The final solution metrics were:
- RMSE: 822.83
- RMSE Percentage: 16.85%

Below you will find our predictions:
