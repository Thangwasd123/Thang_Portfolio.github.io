# Enigma Hackathon: Time Series Demand Planning for IDL Logistics

## Overview
This project was developed during the Enigma Hackathon, where our team created a time series forecasting solution for IDL Logistics to predict and optimize supply chain demand.

## 🏆 Challenge
![IDL Logo](IDL%20Logo.png)

IDL Logistics is a logistics forwarder company with over 20 years of experiences. Being a logistics forwarder, meaning their business involve with a lot of fulfillment works. This can range anything from just a small one box order, to a big multi pallets, multi boxes orders. The human resources planning therefore is incredibly important to IDL Logistics
## 🛠️ Solution

We developed an ARIMA-based forecasting system that enables accurate prediction of logistics demand, helping IDL optimize their operations.
