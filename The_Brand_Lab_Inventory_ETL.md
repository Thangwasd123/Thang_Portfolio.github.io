<img src="./Voomy V.png" alt="Voomy Logo" width = 200 />


## Overview
At The Brand Lab B.V., I designed and implemented a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for inventory management, resulting in significant operational improvements and elimination of stock-outs. This system automated data processing from multiple sources, optimized inventory levels, and provided actionable insights through custom dashboards.

## üöÄ Business Impact

- **100% faster data processing** through optimized ETL pipelines
- **100% stock-out elimination** across product categories
- **100% time efficiency gains** in inventory management processes
- **Improved decision-making** with real-time analytics dashboards

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The solution was built using a modern cloud architecture:

```
[Data Sources] ‚Üí [ETL Pipeline] ‚Üí [Data Warehouse] ‚Üí [Analytics Layer] ‚Üí [Dashboards]
```

### Components:

1. **Data Extraction Layer**
   - Integrated with multiple marketplace APIs (Bol.com, Amazon, etc.) using various product id, which was concatenated using a separate database.
   - Automated data collection from warehouse management systems
   - Real-time inventory level monitoring

2. **Processing Layer (AWS Lambda)**
   - Serverless functions for data transformation
   - Automated data quality checks and cleansing
   - Business logic implementation for inventory optimization

3. **Storage Layer (AWS RDS)**
   - Relational database for structured inventory data
   - Historical data retention for trend analysis
   - Optimized schema for query performance

4. **Object Storage (AWS S3)**
   - Raw data storage for audit purposes
   - Image assets for product catalog
   - Backup and archive functionality

5. **Analytics & Visualization (Hex)**
   - Custom dashboards for inventory insights
   - Sales ranking analytics
   - Marketplace performance monitoring

## üíª Technical Implementation

### Languages & Frameworks
- Python for ETL processes and data manipulation
- PostgresSQL for database operations and complex queries
- AWS SDK (Boto3) for cloud resource management

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **AWS Lambda** for serverless compute
- **AWS RDS** for relational database management
- **AWS S3** for object storage
- **AWS CloudWatch** for monitoring and alerts

### Key Technical Challenges

1. **Data Synchronization**
   - Implemented reliable mechanisms to synchronize inventory data across multiple marketplaces
   - Developed conflict resolution strategies for concurrent updates

2. **Image Processing Pipeline**
   - Optimized image processing workflow using AWS S3 Boto API
   - Reduced processing time by 100% through parallel processing

3. **Real-time Stock Management**
   - Created real-time alerting system for low stock levels
   - Implemented predictive ordering based on historical sales data

## üìä Data Processing Flow

```
1. Extract ‚Üí Data collected from marketplace APIs, ERP systems, and warehouse management systems
2. Transform ‚Üí Data cleansing, normalization, and business rule application
3. Load ‚Üí Structured data loaded into AWS RDS for operational use
4. Analyze ‚Üí Custom analytics using Python data science libraries
5. Visualize ‚Üí Interactive dashboards in Hex for stakeholder insights
```

## üìà Methodology & Process

1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Check in with founders for deliverables requirements.
   - System audit to identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks

2. **Solution Design**
   - Cloud architecture planning for scalability
   - Database schema optimization
   - ETL process mapping

3. **Iterative Development**
   - Agile implementation with two-week sprints
   - Continuous integration and deployment
   - Incremental feature releases

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - KPI tracking for system performance
   - Business metrics for inventory optimization
   - Cost monitoring for cloud resources

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Machine learning integration for demand forecasting
- Automated purchase order generation
- Advanced anomaly detection for inventory discrepancies
- Mobile application for on-the-go inventory management

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **AWS Suite**: Lambda, RDS, S3, CloudWatch
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Complementary services
- **Hashicorp Vault**: Secrets management
- **Git**: Version control
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **PostgreSQL**: Database management
- **Hex**: Data visualization and dashboards
